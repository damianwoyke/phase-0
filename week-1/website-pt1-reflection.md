## How to create & clone a repo via GitHub.##
  When going to create your first repo (repository) you will need to open up GitHub in your web browser. You should see a page with your Username and avatar on the right and a list of your repos on the left. Click the bright green "New repository" button to the right. This next page is fairly straight forward and self directed. Here you will have to give your repo a name, decided if it is public or private, or if you would like to add a license. Once you are done setting up your repository on Github, you are going to want to clone it to your computer. Assuming you have git installed proceed as follows. To clone the repo you will have to open up the command line and type "git clone <repo_Url>" the repo url can be found either in the address bar when you click into the repository and in the box that says HTTPS the the left of the "download zip" button. and there you go, you've created and cloned/copied the repo to your computer.

## Questions ##

 * Code is open source when someone shares it to the public and allows them to look at/edit and change the code however they please.

 * I think that Open Source is great, it is the fastest way to move technology forward. It's exciting that such a large group of people would be willing to work together and share for the better.

 * Licenses are extremely important, they let other people know if they can use your code and how.

 * This challenge solidified how to create and clone repos, I feel like I am able to do that efficiently now. I spelled my username wrong the first time around, which was annoying, but I was able to correct the error delete the clone and then add it back with the correct name.
