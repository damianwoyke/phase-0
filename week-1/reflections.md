# Think About Time
I watched BJ Fogg’s video on tiny habits, this was very interesting and seems that it would be a great way to plant good habits into your life. I also read about Time Boxing, and the Pomodoro technique. Both of these methods are very similar in that you break down a longer process into pieces. In the Pomodoro technique you break things down into 25min intervals. In Time Boxing you take a project/task and break it into mins, hours, weeks, months etc.. decided by yourself or your team depending. You work on each Item however it’s broken down until the time frame is up. Once the time frame is up, take a break, reflect, celebrate maybe re-calculate timeframes if need be. Currently I’m trying out the Pomodoro technique, before this I never really thought about time management, I suppose I use a method of Time Boxing on most days, by finding when I’ll have time allowing myself to work during that and not much more. I think my current strategy is working, I could be more deliberate with how much time I spend on an item and when I do so. I want to try Tiny Habits, I think this would be a great way to change everyday life for the better. During Phase 0 I want to continue a version of the Pomodoro Technique as well as setting daily goals for what gets done.

# The Command Line

The terminal is a shell the box or window that runs bash, which is the language we use to get our computer to do the things we want. The most challenging part of The Command Line Crash Course was that sometimes I didn’t have the files they were asking for. I remembered setting them up and then deleting them, then two chapters later I needed them back, It was an easy fix, but confusing at first (I may be at fault here). I’m fairly certain that each of the commands ran correctly. I did however have a syntax error of sorts when using the “find” command, but I worked through that. I do not think the “apropos” command worked correctly; the output from is was hardly readable. For myself, I found that the most important commands to know were ls,cd,mkdir,touch,rm close to everything it taught us. Anything that involves: figuring out where you are, creating, destroying, and reading, are really important to know.



pwd - print working directory

ls - lists items in current directory including files & other directories

mv - renames files

cd - changes to a different directory depending on the suffix

../ -   moves you to the next folder up when used after “cd” can help you move faster through the directory chain when linked.

touch - lets you create a file

mkdir - lets you create a directory

less - is a way of showing a .txt file in multiple pages instead of filling the whole screen+

rmdir - used to remove a directory

rm - used to remove files from a directory

help - helps you figure out how things work


# Forking and Cloning

*How to fork, clone and create repos using git and GitHub:*

First to create a repo, head over to GitHub and then click on your profile, in the top corner there is a plus sign, click that and then add new repo. There you can name it, add a description, set it as public or private and add a license. Forking a repo is really easy, again you go onto GitHub, find a repo someone has been working on and click the fork icon usually found on the top right of the paige. That’s it now you have a copy of their repo on your GitHub account. To pull this repo to our computer you’ll have to clone it by opening up your terminal. First copy the url to the repo via GitHub, then in the terminal change (“cd”) to the directory you want to load the repo into and then type ‘git clone <URL>’ the repo will start to load into your directory and let you know when it has finished. Forking can be really useful, when working with open source, you would not have to create a whole new file and copy each piece of code over into hundreds of files. Instead you can take the whole project you need and on GitHub it will let people know where you forked the code from.



I didn’t really have any issues setting up git or GitHub. The only issue that I had was in the terminal; as soon as I initialized git it changed the user name to a bunch of gibber gabber, that looked like a color code of some sort. Other students were having the same problem, I figured out loading a different app (iTerm) to run the terminal fixed (covered up) this issue.
