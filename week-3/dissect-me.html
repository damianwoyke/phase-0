    <h1>Git Hub and Version Control</h1>
    <h2>A very basic overview.</h2>

        The command line, git and GitHub are the staples of coding and version control. GitHub is a repository hosting service, meaning it can hold all of our files and folders when coding. It’s great interface also makes it easy for managing and sharing projects/repos a.k.a. repositories. The command line matched with git is how we communicate to GitHub.

          Using CLI (command line) we can “git clone” or copy our repos to our computer. Doing this makes sure that we can edit our files offline, we can also get to them from anywhere, by cloning/pulling them to any computer. When you make an edit on the file locally, it does not automatically update online, you must tell it to do so, this helps prevent from sharing broken code. Another safety precaution we can use is to edit on a new branch. A good way to see branches are as versions of the master(trunk) code where you branch off with new code that hasn’t been tested yet. This prevents breaking the master file that other people could be working on as well. Once your code (branch) is properly tested and works you can merge it with the master code. This whole process is part of version control.

         Version control is a way that people keep track of changes made to their code, each update we commit to GitHub, GItHub keeps track of. This again helps make sure that when/if the code breaks we can go back to a past version that worked and fix any issues that seemed to have arrived in our code.

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  - the basic html, body, head, as well as header, p, and section. These are the most used, because they hold the main information and are MVP tags really.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  - The browser reads them from top to bottom in a way, they are also organized in a tree form. This meaning that the HTML tag has two children like head,body. Then it goes into those branching off of head and body.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  - Well we learned about snippets, they seem really handy. I'm not sure how often I will create new ones at this point, but I know that I will use the one I made constantly. I can see that for maybe certain projects or parts of repetative code they can be really helpful.
