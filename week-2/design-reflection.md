**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

  1. Information Gathering
  2. Planning
  3. Design
  4. Dev
  5. Testing and Delivery
  6. Maintenance


**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

  The primary goal of my site is to provide the tech community with information about my work who I am and access to my blog where I post about things I've learned to help teach others.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

  My target audience is new members of the Dev community such as myself and people/companies looking to hire me. My site is there to provide information about what I've learned and what I've worked on.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

  The primary action is to see my portfolio, and then contact me. The reasons for contact may be different between people.


**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
  Communication is key when it comes to both design and user experience. Keeping a link between the designer and company should remain close, providing updates on how the site is coming along. Sending them mockups and progress reports are key ways to keep this connection. With UX it's important to keep in touch with your demographic to make sure that the site is intuitive and easy to use.


**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

  UXD is designing the site with the user in mind. Again making it intuitive and usable for whoever your target user may be. With a good UXD you can keep users on your site for longer and they will be able to get to your/their end goal easier.


**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

  Figuring out the relative path for the image while continuously pushing code that didn't work. It sure did feel great when solved though.
