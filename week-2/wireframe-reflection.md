#Wireframe Reflection#

**What is a wireframe?**
 A wireframe is a like a plan or blueprint for a website or app. Usually drawn at first, but can vary as to how in-depth it goes.

**What are the benefits of wire framing?**
  A wireframe helps the person creating the website to see how the site should look to some extent. It also help, the dev to code out the structure of the application. It can be good to show clients the wireframe as well and talk with them about the functionality of it all.

**Did you enjoy wire framing your site?**
  It was fun drawing out the site. I used Adobe Comp on the iPad and it really helped to move things along.


**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**
  I ended up revising the wireframe just a bit, I found that in one iteration the navigation bar was too bit, another the blog was taking up too much space on the page. I ended up scaling things and adding a Archive navigation in the blogs.


**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?** I did a little bit more research on apps and web apps that help you with wire framing, I ended up with Adobe's product because I'm a member of CreativeCloud. Other than that the challenge was pretty straight forward.


**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?** I enjoyed the entire challenge, nothing was too tedious or stressful.
