<!--
  What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an acutal site?
      It was fairly simple. I already knew a bit of HTML, this felt like a refresh of the basics. We did have to look up a few small things like the © and ® syntax for html.

  How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
      Most everything we used in this challenge we learned in this module, though with what we did have to look up, it was fairly easy to find.

  How did you do at keeping the best practices?
      We did great; we simply put the txt in with the only formatting being Headers(h1) & lists (ul,li).

  What seems good and bad about HTML?
      HTML is pretty straight forward so far, that is a good thing, it makes it eaiser to learn, no crazy syntax. As far as my knowlege of HTML takes me at this point, I think maybe the only bad thing is that it can be easy to format things while using html, which I think can then inturn mess up your CSS.

  What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
      I don't really have any tricks for remembering how to write HTML.. I guess maybe the fact that the head goes ontop of the body, and the body is where you <p>... I think thats how they taught it to me in highschool.
